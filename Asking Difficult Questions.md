# Asking Difficult Questions

I am very curious about what is real, true, good and beautiful, and generally all aspects of reality. As such I love talking and sharing experiences, and asking people questions about their experience. Doing so often reveals new aspects of reality to both of us and helps us grow into fuller beings. 

Put another way, I love talking with the intention of learning [[What is True]].

Sone difficult questions I like asking myself are:

- What is true? How am I sure?
- What do I desire to receive?
- What do I desire to give?
- What am I?
