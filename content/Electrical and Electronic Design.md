# Electrical and Electronic Design

## Definition
Electrical and Electronic design is the process of designing arrangements of components that perform some function that relies on the principles of electricity and magnetism.

Electronics typically refers to designs that involve smaller "active" often built with semiconductors, such as transistors, integrated circuits and microcontrollers and assembled onto a printed circuit board.

Electrical refers to designs that are built primarily without semiconductors, and include things like home and automotive wiring, and connecting larger components with wires and cables.


## My Experience
I have designed several electronic systems:

- 6 channel DMX Controlled lighting system for dimming large AC loads
- Laser Tag set
- Scissor lift controller
- Emergency door opener 
-  Manufacturing controller prototype for aerospace
- LED Lighting panels
- Solar charge controller prototype
- Audio player and recorder with MIDI support
