# Embedded Systems

I define embedded systems as machines that have computing technology embedded within them. It may be easier to provide a few examples:

- A digital thermostat
- A modern blender with digital speed control
- A car, specifically the Engine Control Unit
- Certain parts of cellphones, such as the touch screen, GPS, audio subsystem
- Most "Internet of Things" devices like smart light bulbs
- WiFi Router
- Computer Mouse
- Solar charger/MPPT


In general, does it have some "intelligence" to it in the form of electronics, then it is likely an Embedded System.
