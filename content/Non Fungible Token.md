# Non-Fungible Token

I define Non-Fungible Token as a specific [[JSON Document|document]] who's [[ownership]] is recorded into a blockchain, or other distributed ledger. 

In this case, [[ownership]] is defined as a bidirectional mapping from an NFT and a public key or identity. This digital ownership by itself does not constitute [[ownership]] in a legal or lawful sense, but simply associating a public key with a [[hash]] of a [[JSON Document|document]].


## Lawful Ownership
Legal or [[Law|lawful]] [[ownership]] can be established by following certain conventions, and mapping agreements between minds to agreements demarcated in code and cryptographic statements.

![[Cryptographic Statements]]
### Mapping Cryptographic Statements to Lawful Statements
For a cryptographic statement to have the power of [[Law]] in the [[Real World]], people using them must agree what they mean.

In the above example, what does `owner: "email@example.org"` really mean? Does it mean that whoever controls the email address `email@example.org` is the owner of the given  **iPhone**? What happens if someone guesses the password to the email address? Are they now the lawful owner of the iPhone?

Perhaps there is another mutually agreed upon document describing how to establish the true owner of a digital asset, in this case the email address? Perhaps we agree that to own an email, you need [[ownership]]  of an NFT signed by the email provider that is also signed by at least **5** people?

The details of how to establish [[ownership]] of digital entities, and how [[ownership]] of a digital entity maps to [[ownership]] of a physical entity is up for debate and ultimately up to the people using the NFTs to decide. If people cannot agree, then the technology will not magically save us.
