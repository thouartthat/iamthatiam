I am that I am. I am here as man. You may call me Isaac. As the author, the words I write are not tendered for interpretation. They mean what I say.

I state that the fundamental property of I came to be here at the moment of fertilization, as a unique singularity known as the zygote and has evolved to be the body i live in now.

I claim the mind, body, and soul, and all that arises from I are the true property of I.

I m not property of any man, person, corporation, legal entity or creation of man, spirit or god or other power or entity.

I am the sovereign and true owner of i and all property of I.

I reserve all rights of i forever.
