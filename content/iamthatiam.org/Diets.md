# Diets

I've tried not eating meat, primarily eating meat, not eating carbs, fasting, and throughout all of these being mindful of the energy and nutritional content of food, as well as presence of harmful "toxins".

If you feel like giving these labels:

- Vegetarian
- Carnivore 
- Ketogenic
- Fasting


I have successfully lost over 60 pounds intentionally, and kept them off for years. More importantly, my energy level, and confidence in my body and health is higher than ever. A lot of this is because of [[Do Inner work and share|inner work]] I have done, but some of it is due to some specific knowledge I have acquired and applied. I'm happy to discuss my experience with eating and health, though I don't claim to be an expert, nor do I claim my approach will work for you.
