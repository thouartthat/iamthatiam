I define inner work, or working on the part of consciousness that is inside, subjective and internal; it is the process of learning what and who we are, what is moral, how our minds and bodies work, and how can we guide our development as conscious beings, rather than allowing our consciousness to flow without guidance on a river of pre-existing habitual patterns.

A big part of my journey has been learning what mental and emotional processes don't serve me well, or are poorly understood. Why do feelings of anger arise in certain circumstances? How do I respond to this anger without hurting anyone, and instead channeling that energy towards my own intentions? How do I handle this moment of depression? How do I welcome and love parts of self that have been abandoned?

I have found mediation, long walks, exercise, certain plants, eating well, and sleeping well as fundamental tools to becoming a more complete man and conscious being.

I have found I desire to connect with other beings, and give and receive [[value]]. I feel and hope I am not alone in this. I define value as that which consciousness gives "positive" attention to.

I have found I can create value for others, and I have found that others can create value for me. As all of us creates value, creating value is life.
