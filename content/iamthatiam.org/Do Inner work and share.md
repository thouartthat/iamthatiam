I define inner work as working with the parts of our human experience that is inside, subjective and internal. Through inner work we learn to connect and feel our feelings, act morally, and live freely, not enslaved by the unconscious patterns of our minds.

How can one be free and act in the outer world when one's body, mind, and inner experience is an emotional battleground? How can one act morally when the demons of unconscious reactive thought patterns govern our actions?

By bringing more awareness to my inner experience, I have come to live more freely, more vigerously and with greater harmony with my self and others.
