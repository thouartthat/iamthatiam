## The Ida of Value Exchange
Each and every living being creates value in this realm we call reality or earth or "the world". As beings with free will, we can exchange value with each other. You may call this "trade", or "barter", or even "hiring someone", but the idea is if you have something I value, and I have something you value, we can agree to exchange it.
