# Law
I define [[Law]] in very simple terms. Law is what a conscious entity lays down as boundaries, or conditions of interactions with other conscious entities. I make my own law, and so do you. As long as our law does not conflict, and we do not cause harm to each other this is all we need. 

As interactions get more complex, we may decide to have large discussions about what is right and wrong, and what common boundaries are, as a baseline. 

There is a long rich history of different kinds of law, different [[jurisdiction]]s, and I will not go into them much now.
