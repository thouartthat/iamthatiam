Website Overview

Otter

start a website and brainstorm. I am building a website to share who I am what I have to offer what I'd like to do and what I'd like to receive

the website will be grouped into a couple of different sections.

There will be some sort of an about page that will be labeled the homepage. It will say things like I am here to create a world without scarcity my might explain a bit about why the website is structured the way it is and why the language is a bit unusual.

There will be an exchange page. Exchange page we'll discuss the idea of exchanging value for value in the true capitalist sense or the true sense of sovereign beings that are ruled by no one

and can create the value through a divine inspiration and an exchange and to share this value with others. I will specifically share value I have become skilled at creating which will be what is typically in a resume but I will not only focus on my traditional technical background and work experience, but also include

my experience relevant for my spiritual perspective, such as yoga teacher training, reading, philosophy, cooking, exercise, and health.

I will enumerate my technical skills as well as my non technical skills I will also list what I would like to receive I would like to receive things like a place to live and food to eat. As well as training in certain skills such as martial arts, flying an aeroplane building a house playing musical instruments and more. I will also explain some example exchanges that may feel equitable such as if you can provide a place for me to live, do work and also teach me how to fly a plane and exchange perhaps I will prototype some piece of electrical equipment such as a router or Wi Fi system or appliance or electric vehicle or just about anything.

The idea here is to find something where every being involved in exchange and exchange both receives and gives value and ideally even receives value in the giving.

I think the most pure exchange here would be if I can build and create something from my heart. That gives me joy from the sheer pleasure of creating that but also be valuable to you to receive and in exchange, you also do something for me that is genuinely enjoyable for you to give and for me to receive. And then in this case the total value created. It's larger than a pure equitable exchange and the math here adds up to a world of abundance.

The website will also have instructions on how to give to support one of the causes or passions of mine. This wouldn't be similar to a traditional donate button and may have cryptocurrency public keys for donating Bitcoin or Aetherium or Manero.

As well as perhaps further instructions for contacting me. Should a more specific gift be given there will be a section for my music that I create. There will be a section for any recorded conversations I record. People might call these podcasts. There will also be a section of my writing. This is what people would typically call a blog there may be some additional sections as well, but these are the key ones. Actually one that I did forget is the connect page, which will have instructions or tools for

communicating with me. Technically, this website will be built in as simple a way as possible to enable me to edit it

anywhere and also customize it to be exactly the way I would like it to be I will not use any static site generators or frameworks such as Django or Wordpress. I will build it primarily in PHP if there is a database component I will use MySQL or Maria DB I may add some features such as a visit counter. I would like to add a feature to allow people to subscribe to updates via RSS with customizable feeds. So you can create a feed that only has content that you are interested in receiving. So each post of writing or each audio recording will have a set of tags associated with it. And these tags can be used to create a search and that search can be converted into a customized RSS feed.

The content itself will be edited by editing a folder full of markdown files, and perhaps audio and other content files as well. This will allow me to edit it in them Fs notes or any other Markdown editor. And not require a complex content management system. Tags and other metadata will be stored in the YAML frontmatter section of the Markdown file. There will be periodic tasks running via cron to index the files and make the tag database

this is pretty much it. Some content I would like to create right away would be

instructions on setting up matrix and element instructions on setting up an RSS reader the philosophy of RSS the philosophy of your own website the goal of removing scarcity the value of inner work a bunch of my favorite recipes a list of books I like a list of movies I like places I would like to travel to places I have traveled to

general technical articles about programming such as creating a vim rc file. And other notes I have collected over the years but polished to a point where someone else may want to read them
