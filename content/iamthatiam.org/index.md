I am that I am. 

This website is a collection of writings about who and what I am, what I wish to share and give the world, and what I wish to receive. It is a constantly evolving window into the mind of one living man you may call Isaac.

I write about [[What is True]], my [[intention|intentions]], cooking, yoga, [[Electrical and Electronic Design]], [[Foundation of Law]], [[Do Inner work and share|inner work]], and more.
