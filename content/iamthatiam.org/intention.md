I feel that which we call spirit animating my being, in every moment, looking back at me through every eye. I see it when I stand in awe gazing at the primal fire erupting from the ground in showers of molten earth, I feel at when I hold a furry animal in my arms, and I see it in eyes of my beloved when we look at each other.

In a changing world often described as broken, chaotic and frightening, I see the material world as a series of ephemeral moments marking the flow of life towards greater peace and unity.

Imagine we are all infinitely powerful creator beings, each telling the story of the journey home. Imagine what is possible if there are no limits, no constraints and infinite possibility. What would you show the world?

I feel an inner tension in the core of my being, an intention to flow with life, love in every moment, and connect with my self others, and create from my core.

I am releasing this intention by:

1. Doing inner work and sharing
2. Connecting people through the use of traditional technology
3. Discovering new/esoteric/occult technology



## 1. Building and sharing a spiritual foundation of inner work

## 2. Using Traditional Technology to Unite Minds

## 3. Discovering, creating and using advanced technology beyond what seems possible now
I've met some interesting people with extraordinary claims. My bar for determining what is true is very high. If there are people that can prove to my standards that their extraordinary claims are true, such "hidden" or "esoteric" technology may go very far in creating the world of abundance. However, as I've said before, a foundation of Inner Work is...foundational.
