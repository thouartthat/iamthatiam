I see a world without war, without authority, without coercion where people are free from fear being a leading cause of action. In this world people explore what it means to be conscious, what they wish to give, and what they wish to receive, so we may all share and enjoy each and every unique facet of consciousness itself.


I am building this world by:

1. Doing inner work and sharing
2. Uniting People with Traditional Technology
3. Discovering new/esoteric/occult technology


## 1. Building and sharing a spiritual foundation of inner work

## 2. Using Traditional Technology to Unite Minds

## 4. Discovering, creating and using advanced technology beyond what seems possible now
I've met some interesting people with extraordinary claims. My bar for determining what is true is very high. If there are people that can prove to my standards that their extraordinary claims are true, such "hidden" or "esoteric" technology may go very far in creating the world of abundance. However, as I've said before, a foundation of Inner Work is...foundational.

# How To Make this Real
## Practical Reality
What do I actually need to achieve this mission? What would I like to receive, possibly just for my own enjoyment? In the general case, they are documented below.

For the immediate mission of answering the questions about law, doing inner work, and doing enlightened engineering, I need a place to live, healthy food to eat, an internet connection, and the ability to travel and meet with people. I'll be recording some conversations and publishing the audio (Podcast).

In order to support me, you can either provide some of these needs directly, or provide me with some token of value that others will accept in exchange, for example Federal Reserve Notes, records on a blockchain (Cryptocurrency) or "precious" metals.
