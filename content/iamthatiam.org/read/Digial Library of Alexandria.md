# Digital Library of Alexandria

All human knowledge in one place
Organized as giant data structure of relationships

Code to describe the physical world 

Schemas for every aspect of interacting and transforming reality

All open, all a 'pirate' system. 

Zoom into any level of detail, from the overall flow of shipments across the ocean, to the electronics within one phone, down to the semiconductor physics and manufacturing process, and then laterally to the mining, refining and transportation of the raw silicon. 

Intended to be used by people who intend to share, and grow the collective knowledge base, and collaborate. May initially be used by 'outlaws', who don't respect "intellectual property"

- Share all knowledge
- Cause no harm to any living being
- Minimize harm to environment (maybe it's alive too, and it supports us)
- Rational self interest

The Great Global Graph Already "Exists", this project just aims to make it more explicit and open.
