# Agent

An agent is any entity, conscious or not that is the sole responsibility of some controlling principle. 

Agents have a legal definition, and a more metaphysical definition. 

According to the Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute

> An agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of another person. The party an agent is authorized to act for is known as the [principal](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/principal). A [principal-agent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/agency) relationship can either be intentionally created or created by implication through oneâ€™s actions.


In the more metaphysical sense, an agent does not need to be a "person" as such, but simply any arrangement of matter, or really any imaginary entity that acts on behalf of a controlling entity.  If you are playing the board game *Monopoly* your agent is your game piece. The piece is moved around the board, according to your will, and its actions (within the [[Real World|world]] of the *Monopoly*) are done on your behalf.
