Tao Te Ching - Chapter 57

 The more laws and restrictions there are,  
 The poorer people become.  
 The sharper men's weapons,  
 The more trouble in the land.  
 The more ingenious and clever men are,  
 The more strange things happen. 
 The more rules and regulations,  
 The more thieves and robbers
