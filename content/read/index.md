## My Writing

I've written about a lot, mostly for my internal sanity. At times I will publish some writing here.
This website is organized so I can quickly add page, both small and large and create links between them. It serves as a public extension of my brain.

## Writing by Other People I have read, or intend to read

Notice to all reading this: This is a work in progress. I have not checked the text for spelling or grammatical errors, and I have certainly read more books than are listed.

### Sci-Fi
 - The Three Body Problem (Trilogy) 
 - Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the And of the World-Haruki Murakami
 - Wind Bird Chronicles
 - Daemon - Daniel Saurez
 - Freedom TM - Daniel Saurez
 - Lucifer's Hammer - What happens if a meteor hits the earth? Its still more of a wild ride, than thoughtful but quite fun and also dark at times
 - Oryx and Crake (Trilogy), Ive only read first two
 - Seveneves - The moon is going to explode and kill everything on the surface of the planet, so what should people do? Also a fun ride, so maybe it goes in the other category, but also very full of interesting ideas.
 
#### Culture Series - Ian M. Banks
I enjoyed this books as they explore the limits of what people might do if technology is so advanced that the only real limit is one's imagination. 

 - The Hydrogen Sonatas
 - **Consider Phlebas**
 - **Use of Weapons**
 - **Surface Detail**
 - **The Player of Games**
 - **Snow Crash**
 - **Cyrptonomicon** - Neal Stephenson
 
#### Altered Carbon Series
I really enjoyed these as really gritty violent thrillers with deep metaphysical undertones about what it means to be conscious.
 - **Altered Carbon** - Richard K. Morgan
 - **Broken Angels** - Richard K. Morgan
 - **Woken Furies** - Richard K. Morgan

#### Nexus Series - Ramez Naam
These books shows what could happen if we merge with machines.
 - **Nexus** - Ramez Naam
 - **Cruz** - Ramez Naam
 - **Apex** - Ramez Naam
 
#### Honor Harrington Series
 - **All of them!**
