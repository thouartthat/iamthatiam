I am extremely [[What is True|skeptical]] and yet curious about what technology is hidden from the general public. 

Do any of the various "healing" machines actually do anything, or are they snake oil?

Was Nikola Tesla onto anything, or is that an urban legend or "conspiracy theory?" 

If any of these technologies are real, I'd like to learn about them, get a deep working knowledge of how they work, and then perhaps even share them.

I've heard if any of these things do exist, black helicopters will come get you. Therefore, I may need to learn about more about [[Enlightened Engineering/iamthatiam.org/content/exchange/Law|Law]]  before I learn about [[Free Energy]].

Of all my intentions, this is my lowest priority, but if anyone has some true "magical" technology, I will look at it closely and apply all the necessary discernment to learn whether it is real or not.
