# How to ~~Save~~ Destroy the world
## Assumptions

- Traditional "society" and "government" are collapsing
- [[Complexity and Chaos|Complexity]] of top-down management is causing internal collapse (left brain dominant thinking)
- People are disconnected from "dirty reality" of life
- There is a general lack of motivation
- Scarcity Mindset

Sharing knowledge/information does not diminish it

Computers are projections of conscious thought as arrangements of matter and energy.

Stages of consciousness (magical thinking, integral, all that shit)

>It’s an invitation for people to join a world of abundance, rather than scarcity. Perhaps only a fraction of the people living are ready for this. Maybe it first only gets used by the “underbelly” of society to build a new tech base outside the traditional economy, with plans for every machine, every aspect supply chain handled in a mirror/ghost system built in this graph, where people embrace anarchy and self ownership, and do so in a great collaboration of knowledge, and foundation of inner ownership.


How do I tell a story linking all these concepts together?

Underground supply chain - Recipes to build just about anything, in a distributed fashion

- Design files
	- 2D Drawings
	- 3D models (parts)
	- Assemblies
	- Hydraulic schematics
	- Electrical Schematics
	- PCB Layout
	- Fluid handling 
	- Process Control
- Source code
- blueprints
- assembly instructions
-  tolerances
- acceptance criteria
- testing 
	"A Test is a procedure that answers a question about an entity within an environment"
	- Automated procedures
	- Manual procedures

Peer/Node/public key/person/entity

Oracle
Smart Contract
Trust
Delegation of sub-graph
Recursive delegation?

How do you represent an exchange?
	- NFT representing physical object is "minted". 
	- authenticity is verified by Oracle of some kind
	- Put up for escrow
		- Contract created
	- Once both sides agree, released from escrow
	
What types of objects do contracts operate on?
	Obviously parts of the graph, but namespacing is tricky because if a contract operates on a named part of a graph, but the name changes, what does the contract even mean anymore?

Perhaps there needs to be a way to fix/lock parts of ones graph so it can't be edited later.

Are contents of NFTs stored on chain? Or simply hashes?

1. Create read-only entry binding a name to a public key or UUID  (stored on chain), and rules for mutation
2. Create contract/transaction that acts on UUID or name (on chain)
3. Once a path is bound to the chain, then mutations of it must follow rules agreed to on chain
